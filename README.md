# Prusa
Work for Prusa related Projects

Two versions of an analysis document I wrote during a frustrating period where I could not get my MMU2S working with my Prusa Mk3S printer.  I detailed the operation of the MMU, and what were the issues and causes of the various problems. 
This document was sent to prusa on "Eyes only" basis in October 2022.  Several months later, MMU3 was announced.  I hope that my document was one of many voices Prusa listened to in making the decision to improve the MMU.
